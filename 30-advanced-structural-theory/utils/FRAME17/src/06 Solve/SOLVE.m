function DELTA = SOLVE(GLK, GLOAD)
%..........................................................................
%   PURPOSE:   Solve the global stiffness equations for
%              nodal displacements using the banded global
%              stiffness matrix and place the results in
%              DELTA.
%
%   VARIABLES:
%     GLK(NEQ, NSBAND)= global stiffness matrix in banded form
%	  GLOAD(NEQ)     = nodal load vector
%
%   Note that to make things more clear, the displacement vector
%   is stored in array DELTA; you should know that this is in
%   general not necessary because often the displacement vector
%   is also stored in array GLOAD. In addition, this subroutine
%   assumes only a single right-hand side.  It can be modified
%   to handle multiple right-hand sides easily.
%..........................................................................

%     Check for structure instability by examining the diagonal
%     elements of [GLK].  If a zero value is found, print a warning
%     and exit the program.  (Note that as [GLK] is in banded form,
%     the diagonal elements all appear in the first column.)
for i = 1 : length(GLK)
    if find(GLK(i, i) == 0, 1)
        error(['*** ERROR *** Diagonal element found with zero value. ' ...
            'Check structure for instability ' ...
            'Zero coefficient in row ' num2str(i) '.']);
